## About 0xCARNEMUERTA

I’m a cloud-native, security-aware data/ML engineer with a focus on securing the future of AI and APIs.

I explore threat surfaces across:

- Token-based authentication (JWT, OAuth2, RS256)
- Secure data pipelines in Azure & Databricks
- AI model exploitation and prompt injection vulnerabilities

My goal? To break things ethically — and then build them back better, stronger, and safer.

> Exploiting data, securing AI, and living between the tokens and the dead prompts.
